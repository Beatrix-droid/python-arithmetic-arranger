This is my first python project. It was inspired by one of Free Code Camp's challenges that asked one to 
create a function that received a list of strings that were arithmetic problems and returned the problems arranged vertically and side-by-side.
The function was not allowed to accept more than 5 problems, each operand had to be no longer than four digits and the only operations that it accepted 
were addition and subtraction.
